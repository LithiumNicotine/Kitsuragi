## 📘 Quick Guide

Kitsuragi uses a **node-based interface** to make story creation simple and visual:

- **White nodes** represent **displayed dialogue** or story text.
- **Grey subnodes** represent **player choices** or branching options.
- Connect nodes to define how the story progresses from one dialogue to another.
- Each project can be exported into an HTML game that runs directly in a web browser.

> Kitsuragi focuses on simplicity and accessibility, making it ideal for writers, game designers, or anyone interested in creating narrative experiences without coding.
